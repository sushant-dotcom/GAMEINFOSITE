  <h1><marquee behavior="alternate"><font color="blue">Top 5 social features your game must have</font></marquee></h1>
<p>The social phenomenon is hardly a new one.  As two of the most well known social successes, Facebook currently boasts over 750 million daily active users (DAU) and Twitter has more than 100 million.  What’s interesting is the rate at which games are fast catching up.  Candy Crush is probably the best example with nearly 100 million daily active users and still growing.</p>
<p><b><font color="blue">1. Facebook Integration</font></b><br>If you don’t already have your own social network of players, then the last thing you should be trying to do is build one.  Many of the large social networks have provided APIs so that you can use established networks of players that have already invested considerable time building links to their own friends online.  Leverage those.  By integrating existing networks into your game (and you can integrate more than one), you encourage players to do your marketing for you.  Using GameSparks, integration with social networks is straightforward.  As soon as you create your new game object in the main configuration screen, editing that object allows you to enter the App ID and Secrets from the 3rd party network.  GameSparks can then harvest the friend data on the backend and use that data to create things like friend based leaderboards etc.</p>
<p><b><font color="blue">2. Friend Points</font></b><br>Once you have taken the step of integrating the game with a social network, the most important thing to do is to incentivize your players to invite their friends to play the game.  The key issue around this is that people get asked to invite their friends to a lot of things these days so they are inclined to do it sparingly.  We find this mechanic works if the game is good enough and the rewards are integrated well into the core game play.  An example of being well integrated is to reward the players with in-game currency or lives, which both Nosferatu and Candy Crush do very well. </p>
<p><b><font color="blue">3. Gifting</font></b><br>
    Once you embrace the concept of players having a more social experience with their existing friends it is worth exploring how this experience can be made more fulfilling.  Gifting is one way of doing this where the game allows players to exchange virtual items with their friends.  Sending them lives or in-game virtual items can be effective for certain player types.  As a developer, you are trying to find more ways of getting these established networks of friends to engage with each other with the game as the central theme of conversation.</p>
<p><b><font color="blue">4. Social Leaderboards</font></b><br>The leaderboard is one of the oldest and most under-rated social features.  Where gifting appeals more to Socialites, leaderboards appeal directly to the competitive amongst us, or the Killers.

    There is a certain bias towards Killers in the games industry.  A lot of games are created with this player type in mind – games where score, rank, or lap time are important and featured prominently on many of the screens, for example.  These are all designed to bring the competitive side out in us.  It’s hard to imagine these games without leaderboards.</p>
    <p><b><font color="blue">5. Events</font></b><br>Last on the list of top 5 social features are events.  Events can be a useful way of getting players to focus their social activity through the scheduling of tournaments or other multi-player game sessions.  On mobile platforms it’s better to use deadlines than set a fixed time where everyone has to play.  In other words, it is more effective to get players to complete something by a date in the future rather than all have to play at a particular point in time.</p>
