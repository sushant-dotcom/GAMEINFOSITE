  <p align="center">While we started off as a Battlefield 1942 community over a decade ago, the community has flourished in many other games be it the survival style of DayZ or the SCI-Fi realism of Star Citizen, we are always open to introducing and supporting new games to the community.</p>

<h4><u>Make friends with mutants in this soap opera adventure game</u></h4>
Mutants don't always live in ruined buildings or lurk in ruined labs; sometimes they hang out in an old holiday resort, watching bad TV or hitting up the local club with their mutant pals. That's the kind of mutants you can expect to hang out with and befriend in soap opera-style adventure game Mutazione. 100 years ago, a meteor struck a holiday resort, killing almost everyone and mutating the rest. The survivors founded their own community, the titular Mutazione, in the aftermath. They seem to be doing all right. We'll be exploring it as Kai, who is visiting her sick grandfather, Nonno. 

The announcement trailer is so laid back it's hypnotic, and we're promised relaxing activities like making new friends, wandering around the village and planting musical gardens. Pop some seeds in the ground and you'll be able make your own soundtrack, and then you can share your musical plants with other players online. With its gorgeous but understated aesthetic, it looks like the perfect place for a restorative break. It's not without its drama, however; it is a soap opera, after all.

<h4><u>A Year of Rain is a co-op RTS with a competitive streak</u></h4>
First-time RTS developer Daedelic Entertainment, best known for its point-and-click adventure games, has set itself a bit of a challenge with A Year of Rain. It's a co-op RTS where players control hero-led armies across a campaign and skirmishes, and it's already gunning for a slice of the esports pie. 

Three factions are fighting over a pretty miserable-looking realm, clashing in battles that promise to mix traditional RTS shenanigans like gathering resources, building and upgrading a base, and recruiting an army with a focus on legendary heroes and teamwork. 

It will be "esports-ready" at launch, says Daedelic, with a league system, leaderboards, competitive seasons, replays and an observer mode. A 2v2 skirmish mode is being designed specifically for competitive matches, too. 

Games designed with esports in mind are often the least successful when it comes to their focus, and RTS games continue to be largely played for their singleplayer campaigns. Even StarCraft 2, the most popular RTS for almost a decade, relies on its exceptional trio of solo campaigns. A multiplayer-focused esports RTS, then, seems like quite a risk, especially when it's the studio's very first game in the genre.

        <h4><u>Plunder an airship in free stealth game Skyrogue</u></h4>
        <p>hough it was made for this year's 7-Day Roguelike Challenge, there's very little roguelike DNA in DragonXVI's Skyrogue, and that's fine, because it's a satisfying turn-based sneaking game instead. Across five (seemingly handmade) levels, you have to relieve a moving airship of its many glittering gems and gold nuggets, avoiding guards and their blasted sight lines as you go.

            The fundamentals will be familiar to you: the enemy moves when you do, if you enter their sight lines they'll begin to chase you, and if they reach you, well I presume you're chucked in the brig, but the level restarts. You can hop around corners to lose them, or tactically manoeuvre them around, in this colourful and fluidly animated stealth game that feels like a puzzler thanks to its turn-based nature.
            
            Where Skyrogue differs from most stealth games is the addition of a blink move—yep, like the one in Dishonored. Special green gems allow you to jump several steps in a direction, bypassing gaps or merely dodging the ever-present guards. There are some good levels here, but not really enough to make full use of the interesting blinking mechanic. Meanwhile, level 2 might have you quitting the game entirely, as it's surprisingly difficult. My tip for that is to ignore the treasure, and focus on the key.</p>

                <h4><u>Epic says it doesn't use Steam data without permission after Reddit accusations</u></h4>
                <p>Epic Games has responded to accusations that its launcher is secretly mining users' Steam data, saying that the information it collects is used for multiple non-nefarious purposes including its Support-a-Creator program, communicating with the Unreal Editor, and importing your Steam friends list should you opt to. The launcher does scan for active processes, but Epic's vice president of engineering Daniel Vogel said that it does so to ensure that games don't attempt to update while they're running, and that the data is not sent to Epic. 

                    Worries about the Epic launcher's data tracking were sparked by this lengthy Reddit post, which claims, among many other things, that the app enumerates running processes and attempts to access DLLs and root certificates without notifying the user. The author also claimed that data was being transmitted to Epic for unknown reasons, and that it stores hardware information in the registry.   </p>

                        <h4><u>Microsoft is adapting Xbox Live's matchmaking and chat features for PC and other platforms</u></h4>
                        <p>This morning, Microsoft announced a new game developer-focused initiative that brings its already existing game-development platforms, tools, and services under a single ecosystem called Game Stack. Those services include Azure, DirectX, Visual Studio, Xbox Live, App Center, Havok, and others, including PlayFab, a complete backend for building and operating live, multiplayer games. Microsoft's goal with bundling all those services together (which are also available still à la carte) is to make it easier for developers to continually monitor their games' performance and communities, which can mean better game experiences for players.

                            This initiative also means that Microsoft's Azure cloud, which is already available in 54 regions globally, plays a critical role in Game Stack. The global scale of Azure will be the foundation for Project xCloud streaming technology, so developers will have the ability to reach any gamer around the world, regardless of what device they may be gaming on. Cloud gaming is already starting to make PC gaming more accessible, and combining something like PlayFab with Azure only increases cross-platform possibilities within Microsoft's gaming network.</p>
